The AI engineer successfully built the initial MVP of a marketing software (OutreachPulse), then progressively transformed it into a full-fledged ERP system (ZOIOS ERP) based on user requests. Key developments included implementing a robust JWT-based authentication system (login, signup, forgot password), user management with role-based access, comprehensive rebranding, and setting up an initial multi-step company onboarding wizard. Challenges like bcrypt password hashing and import errors were debugged and resolved. The work concluded mid-way through the company setup wizard, with a redirection issue observed after the first step.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to build a marketing software MVP with a dashboard, contact management, telecalling details, and email response tracking, all visualized in a graph-based dashboard. This evolved into:
1.  **Authentication & User Management**: Implement email/password login with JWT, user registration, and a forgot password feature. Admin users should view all data and create/manage other users with defined roles (admin/regular), while regular users see only their own data.
2.  **Branding**: Rebrand the application from OutreachPulse / Marketing CRM to ZOIOS / ZOIOS ERP with a custom logo.
3.  **Email Integration**: The forgot password functionality should send reset links via email using a default ZOIOS SMTP server. Signup should also trigger a welcome email.
4.  **Company Onboarding**: After a new user signs up, they must complete an initial company setup wizard, including company details, country-specific double-entry accounting system selection, and multi-currency functionality, before accessing the main dashboard.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT for tokens,  (initially bcrypt, but changed to hashlib for password hashing).
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   **Email**:  for SMTP integration.
-   **Data Modeling**: Pydantic for API request/response validation, UUIDs for IDs.
-   **Deployment**: Docker (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml), Nginx for frontend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****: Main FastAPI application. Handles API routes for dashboard, contacts, call logs, email responses, authentication (login, signup, password reset), user management, and company setup. It integrates MongoDB interactions, JWT token handling, and calls to . It was heavily modified throughout the development to add new endpoints, models, and middleware for authentication and onboarding.
-   ****: Defines Pydantic models for users, company, and accounting configurations. Contains functions for password hashing, JWT token creation/validation, and user-related database operations. Initially used , but switched to  due to issues.
-   ****: New file. Contains functions  and  using . Configured via environment variables.
-   ****: New file. Stores predefined lists of countries, accounting systems, and currencies for the company setup wizard.
-   ****: Central React component. Sets up routing using  and integrates the  and . Routes include , , , , , , , , , and .
-   ****: New file. Provides authentication state (, , , ) and methods (, , , , , ). Manages token storage and user session.
-   ****: Provides the login UI. Was updated to include links to signup and forgot password, remove demo credentials, update branding, and enlarge the logo.
-   ****: New file. Provides the user registration UI.
-   ****: New file. Provides the UI for requesting a password reset email.
-   ****: New file. Provides the UI for setting a new password using a reset token.
-   ****: New file. A React component that wraps routes requiring authentication. It now also redirects users to the  route if their  status is .
-   ****: New file. Admin-only interface for viewing and managing users.
-   ****: New file. Implements the multi-step company onboarding wizard, collecting company information, accounting system, and multi-currency details.
-   ** files (, )**: Store environment-specific configurations like , ,  (for JWT), and email server details (, , etc.).

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve the redirection issue in the company setup wizard after completing the first step, ensuring the new user can finish the onboarding process.
-   Implement the remaining steps of the company setup wizard (accounting system and multi-currency configuration).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the multi-step company onboarding wizard.
1.  **Backend Changes**: New Pydantic models for  and  were added, and the  model now includes an  flag. Endpoints for company setup () were created in , and the user creation process (, admin user creation) was modified to set  to  for new users.
2.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *    was created to handle the multi-step wizard UI.
    *    was updated to check the  status of the logged-in user.
    *    was modified to redirect users to  if they are logged in but  is .
3.  **Current State**: A new user can successfully sign up. Upon logging in, they are redirected to the company setup wizard. Step 1 (Company Information) has been implemented and is visible. However, after submitting step 1, the application unexpectedly redirects back to the login page, indicating a potential issue with token expiration or the authentication flow when transitioning between setup steps. The last action was to attempt logging in again with the test user to continue the setup.
