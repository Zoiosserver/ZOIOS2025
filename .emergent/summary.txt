The AI engineer's work, documented in this trajectory, primarily focused on refining the ZOIOS ERP application, moving from initial setup to enhancing complex features. The early phase involved fixing critical UI/UX issues such as tab navigation in  and ensuring correct display of currency names, with extensive debugging of frontend rendering and  attributes. A significant effort was then directed towards resolving backend  serialization errors and incorrect database routing, particularly for sister company creation, consolidated accounts, and currency management. User management was expanded to include granular, menu-based permissions. Recurring issues included persistent currency symbol display errors,  exchange rate updates, and  user deletion problems, often stemming from frontend state management or backend data serialization. The engineer iteratively applied fixes, often restarting services and relying on testing agent feedback, and also introduced a Company submenu for better UI organization. The work concluded with ongoing efforts to fully implement the granular permission system and resolve persistent currency display and user deletion bugs.

<product_requirements>
The application, ZOIOS ERP, has evolved from a marketing MVP and includes the following features and user requirements:

1.  **Authentication & User Management**: Secure email/password login with JWT, registration, forgot/reset password. Role-based access (admin/regular) for data and user management, with new users defaulting to 'admin'.
2.  **Branding**: Rebranded from OutreachPulse to ZOIOS ERP with a custom 150x150 logo across all key pages.
3.  **Email Integration**: Send welcome and password reset emails via a ZOIOS SMTP server.
4.  **Company Onboarding**: A multi-step wizard for new users:
    *   Basic company details, including specifying the fiscal year start date.
    *   Selection of country-specific double-entry accounting system.
    *   Multi-currency functionality with online rate fetching (with fallback/mock rates) and manual override.
    *   Inclusion of Private Limited Company and Group Company business types.
5.  **Group Company & Consolidated Accounts**: If Group Company is selected, allow adding multiple sister companies with their own details (country, accounting system, fiscal year, ownership percentage). A Consolidated Accounts view is required for group companies to show data from all entities.
6.  **Multi-Tenancy**: Data isolation for each group company, ensuring its own database.
7.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Ensure full country names are displayed, streamline tab navigation, consolidate CRM and company functions into organized submenus, display company/accounting details on the dashboard.
8.  **Account Management**: Ability to add new accounts with auto-generated codes based on type, and manage opening balances for each account.
9.  **Granular Permissions**: Implement menu-based access control, allowing specific user access to individual menu items (e.g., Currency Management, Company Accounts).
10. **Database Management**: Functionality to clean all test data (users, companies, tenant DBs) for fresh testing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a series of reported issues from the user (Chat Message 499):

The user confirmed that New Users Default to Admin is working, and the Company Assignments menu is loading (but has internal issues). However, the following issues are still *not working*:
1.  **Currency Exchange Rates**: Updated undefined exchange rates persists, and not loading any currency. The ability to edit additional currencies is also requested.
2.  **Account Code Auto-Generation**: Still shows 1000 for Asset type, even if 1000 already exists, instead of the next available code.
3.  **Currency Symbol Display**: INR symbol still shows  instead of ₹ in currency management configuration and company accounts when selecting a company.
4.  **User Deletion**: The delete button for  is not working. The super admin  is correctly protected.
5.  **Consolidated Accounts**: Confirmed working (shows all 3 companies), but aesthetic improvements are noted for later.

The AI engineer's immediate plan (Chat Message 704 onwards) is to:
1.  **Fix sidebar currency icon and add currency editing functionality**: This involves modifying  to create a dynamic icon for currency management, and  to enable editing of additional currencies.
2.  **Fix the permission system to actually hide menu items when permissions are No**: This involves adding permission checking logic to , starting with adding a hook to get user permissions.

The last action in the trajectory was modifying  to add a hook for user permissions, as part of implementing the granular menu-based access control (Chat Message 712). The backend and frontend services were previously restarted (Chat Message 671, 673).

<optional_next_step>
Implement the  hook in  and integrate it to dynamically show/hide menu items based on user permissions.
