The AI engineer's work in this trajectory was highly iterative, primarily focused on UI/UX enhancements, fixing critical frontend-backend communication issues, and progressively adding core ERP features. Key achievements include redesigning login/signup/company setup pages for a professional look, implementing dynamic sister company functionality, integrating a new ZOIOS logo (iterating from SVG to direct PNG use), ensuring mobile responsiveness, fixing a persistent backend validation error (FastAPI 422) by correcting data schema mismatches, and enabling a robust Forgot Password flow. The latest major task involved significantly upgrading the dashboard for admin users and beginning the implementation of comprehensive company and chart of accounts management, including export functionalities. Persistent debugging of frontend errors, especially syntax issues, and backend API mismatches, was a recurring theme.
