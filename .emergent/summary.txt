The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative process focused on building out a multi-tenant ERP application. Initial efforts centered on modernizing the UI/UX for core authentication flows (login, signup, forgot password) and company onboarding, ensuring mobile responsiveness and consistent branding. A significant phase involved implementing backend API endpoints for company and chart of accounts management, followed by integrating these into the React frontend. Key challenges included persistent FastAPI validation errors (422), MongoDB ObjectId serialization, JWT authentication issues, and resolving field mapping mismatches between frontend and backend. The work progressed to enhance the dashboard with business intelligence features and modular navigation. User feedback consistently highlighted display issues, broken functionalities, and incomplete module implementations, leading to continuous debugging and refinement, particularly around sister company display and user permissions.

<product_requirements>
The ZOIOS ERP application requires:
1.  **Authentication & User Management**: Secure login/registration, forgot/reset password, role-based access, new users default to 'admin'.
2.  **Branding**: Rebranded to ZOIOS ERP with custom logo. All pages must use the exact provided ZOIOS logo.
3.  **Company Onboarding**: Multi-step wizard including: fiscal year, country-specific accounting systems, multi-currency, Private Limited Company and Group Company types with sister company options, and address collection. The company setup page must be visually professional.
4.  **Group Company & Consolidated Accounts**: For Group Company type, allow adding sister companies and a Consolidated Accounts view.
5.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhanced professional design for login, signup, company setup, and dashboard pages; mobile compatibility; and logout option during company setup.
6.  **Account Management**: CRUD operations for company data, separate Chart of Accounts for each company, and a consolidated Chart of Accounts for group companies.
7.  **Data Export/Print**: Capabilities to print (PDF, direct) and export (Excel) Chart of Accounts.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues reported by the user, primarily focusing on frontend display and functional problems within the newly enhanced ERP system. The most pressing issue being investigated is the **sister company display** in the  section. Despite backend testing confirming that sister companies are correctly saved and fetched via the API, they are not being rendered on the frontend. This suggests a frontend logic or data parsing problem.

Other reported issues include  showing errors, non-functional  section buttons,  lacking full permissions and an unresponsive Add user button, a non-working View Chart of Accounts button from the company management section, inability to edit company details (like logo or address), an unimplemented  module, persistent  errors, and the  key not closing popup windows. The engineer had just completed backend fixes related to super admin initialization and API field mapping.
