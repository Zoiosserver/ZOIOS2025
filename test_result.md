# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     stuck_count: 0

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The user's complaint 'indian rupee still shows half not fully' is VALID. Previous testing agent reports were incorrect - there IS still a display truncation issue that needs immediate attention.

DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) **Base Currency Dropdown**: ✅ Shows full 'INR ₹ - Indian Rupee' text correctly (19 elements tested, all showing complete text) 2) **Additional Currencies Grid**: ❌ TRUNCATION CONFIRMED - Found specific currency card showing truncated 'Indian GAAP / Ind AS' text 3) **Accounting System Info**: ❌ Text truncation detected in accounting standards display 4) **CSS Analysis**: No CSS-based truncation detected, but visual truncation still present 5) **Responsive Testing**: Issue persists across desktop (1920px), tablet (768px), and mobile (390px) views. CONCLUSION: The user's complaint 'indian rupee still shows half not fully' is 100% VALID. The main agent's aggressive CSS fixes with !important rules and min-width 600px are NOT sufficient to resolve the truncation issue. The problem appears to be in specific text display areas, particularly in the accounting system information section. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to investigate container width constraints and text overflow in the accounting system display area (around 'Indian GAAP / Ind AS' text) and implement more targeted fixes for these specific truncation points."

ISSUE FOUND: 1) **422 HTTP Error**: Server responds with 422 status when submitting complete company setup form 2) **React Error**: 'Objects are not valid as a React child' error appears, indicating backend is returning validation error objects instead of proper response 3) **Form Submission**: All form fields are properly filled (company name, address, city, state, postal code) but submission fails 4) **API Endpoint**: /api/setup/company endpoint is returning validation errors instead of processing the request successfully. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to investigate the backend validation logic and ensure proper error handling in the company setup API endpoint. The frontend form data appears correct, so this is likely a backend validation or processing issue."
