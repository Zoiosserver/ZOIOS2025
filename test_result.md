# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The user's complaint 'indian rupee still shows half not fully' is VALID. Previous testing agent reports were incorrect - there IS still a display truncation issue that needs immediate attention.

DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) **Base Currency Dropdown**: ✅ Shows full 'INR ₹ - Indian Rupee' text correctly (19 elements tested, all showing complete text) 2) **Additional Currencies Grid**: ❌ TRUNCATION CONFIRMED - Found specific currency card showing truncated 'Indian GAAP / Ind AS' text 3) **Accounting System Info**: ❌ Text truncation detected in accounting standards display 4) **CSS Analysis**: No CSS-based truncation detected, but visual truncation still present 5) **Responsive Testing**: Issue persists across desktop (1920px), tablet (768px), and mobile (390px) views. CONCLUSION: The user's complaint 'indian rupee still shows half not fully' is 100% VALID. The main agent's aggressive CSS fixes with !important rules and min-width 600px are NOT sufficient to resolve the truncation issue. The problem appears to be in specific text display areas, particularly in the accounting system information section. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to investigate container width constraints and text overflow in the accounting system display area (around 'Indian GAAP / Ind AS' text) and implement more targeted fixes for these specific truncation points."

          comment: "⚠️ ENHANCED PDF EXPORT ENDPOINTS EXIST BUT UNTESTABLE: The PDF export endpoints (POST /api/companies/{company_id}/accounts/export and POST /api/companies/consolidated-accounts/export) exist in the backend, but testing was blocked because new users don't have companies available for testing. The endpoints should return structured data with company_info, table_data (with headers and rows), and summary fields. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should test these endpoints with an existing company setup to verify the enhanced structure returns proper data format for frontend processing."

CRITICAL SUCCESS: Sister company functionality is working perfectly with proper database persistence and API integration. Main issues are with super admin credentials and company creator permission assignment."MMENDATION: Main agent should investigate authentication flow and ensure proper user session management after account creation.

FINDINGS: ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: This is NOT a bug but correct multi-tenant behavior - each user is isolated to their own tenant database and can only see their own companies ✅ **COMPANY MANAGEMENT API WORKING PERFECTLY**: All CRUD operations tested successfully (GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints) ✅ **BUSINESS TYPE TESTING COMPLETE**: Successfully created companies with all expected business types (Private Limited Company, Public Limited Company, Partnership, Sole Proprietorship, Group Company) ✅ **DATABASE INVESTIGATION SUCCESSFUL**: Backend logs confirm proper tenant isolation - each user gets their own database (e.g., zoios_tenant_xxx) ✅ **USER PERMISSIONS VERIFIED**: Admin users can access company management endpoints correctly ✅ **MULTI-TENANCY WORKING AS DESIGNED**: Data isolation prevents users from seeing other users' companies, which is the intended security feature. CONCLUSION: The reported 'filtering issue' is actually correct system behavior. In a multi-tenant ERP system, users should only see companies in their own tenant database for security and data isolation. The Company Management system is working correctly and no fixes are needed."

KEY ISSUES: 1) **Company Setup UI Bug**: When selecting 'Group Company' business type during company setup, the sister company section does not appear - this prevents users from adding sister companies during the onboarding process. 2) **Frontend Display Problems**: The CompanyManagement.js fixes for companiesWithSisters state management are not working correctly - sister companies are not being displayed in the Company Management section even when they exist in the backend. 3) **State Management Issues**: The critical fix mentioned in the review (companiesWithSisters state management) is not functioning as intended. BACKEND STATUS: ✅ Backend is working correctly - logs show successful sister company creation and proper API responses. FRONTEND STATUS: ❌ Frontend has multiple display and UI issues preventing proper sister company functionality.

Tested with 26 accounts - all showing proper field mapping: account_code='1000', account_name='Cash and Cash Equivalents', etc. No more N/A values. ✅ **FIX #3: Consolidated Accounts Field Mapping Fix**: GET /api/companies/consolidated-accounts/enhanced endpoint now correctly returns consolidated accounts with account_code and account_name fields.
